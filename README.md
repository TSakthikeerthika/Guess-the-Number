# Guess the Number

--> I created a simple webpage for using HTMl, CSS, JavaScript.<br/>
--> I named it as "Guess the Number".<br/>
--> At start a player get 10 points as score.<br/>
--> By entering numbers 1 to 10 and comparing it with the random number generated by system, the score will be add and reduced by 1 point.<br/>
--> Until the score becomes 0 the game can be play!<br/>
